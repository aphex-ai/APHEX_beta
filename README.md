        short_ema = ta.ema(self.candles, 8)
        long_ema = ta.ema(self.candles, 21)
        return short_ema > long_ema

    def go_long(self):
        entry_price = self.price - 10       # limit buy $10 below current price
        qty = utils.size_to_qty(self.balance * 0.05, entry_price)  # risk only 5%
        
        self.buy = qty, entry_price
        self.take_profit = qty, entry_price * 1.2   # 20% profit target
        self.stop_loss = qty, entry_price * 0.9     # 10% stop loss
